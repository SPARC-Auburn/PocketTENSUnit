# PocketTENSUnit
Many professionally made TENS units can cost hundreds of dollars. The goal of this project is to find information and build a smaller unit that can serve the same purpose. 

A TENS unit stands for Transcutaneous Electrical Neural Stimulator. It sends small amounts of currents between two electrodes on the body at high voltages in order to stimulate the nerves and muscles. This can have medical advantages. 

The part list for such a device, without using Arduino as the function generator is shown below, and the diagram is found here(To be linked).
